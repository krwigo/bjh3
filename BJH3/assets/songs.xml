Their genitals protrude when,
They’re running in the nude oh,
The Hash House Harriers.</verse>
		<verse>They’re always shiggy tracking,
From constantly bushwacking.
Intelligence their lacking,
The Hash House Harriers.</verse>

		<verse>Our lager,
Which art in barrels;
Hallowed be thy drink;
Thy will be drunk,
At home as it is in the tavern.
Give us this day our foamy head.
And forgive us our spillages,
As we forgive those who spill against us.
And lead us not into incarceration;
But deliver us from hangovers.
For thine is the Beer,
The Bitter, and the Lager,
Forever and ever.
On-on!</verse>

		<info>(Tune of Do Your Ears Hang Low?)</info>
		<verse>Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to a fro?
Can you tie ‘em in a knot?
Can you tie ‘em in a bow?
*Can you throw ‘em over your shoulder,
*Like a continental soldier?
Do your balls hang low?</verse>
		<info>CHORUS:</info>
		<verse>Ting-a-ling, God damn,
Find a woman if you can.
If you can’t find a woman,
Find a clean old man.
If your ever in Gibraltor,
Take a flying fuck at Walter.
Do you do a double shuffle,
When your balls hang low?</verse>
		<info>*Additional verses for measures 5 and 6:</info>
		<verse>Do they make a lusty clamor,
When you hit ‘em with a hammer?
Can you bounce them off the wall,
Like a rubber Super Ball?
Do they have a hallow sound,
When you drag ‘em o n the ground?
Do they have a metal tingle,
When you hit ‘em with a shingle?
Do they have a salty taste,
When you wrap ‘em round your waste?
Do they chime like a gong,
When you pull upon your dong?</verse>

		<verse>Do your tits hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie ‘em in a knot?
Can you tie ‘em in a bow?
Can you throw ‘em over your shoulder?
Do they need a boulder holder?
Do your tits hang low?</verse>
		<verse>Are your tits real small?
Are they flat just like a wall?
Can you find them with your hands?
Are they even there at all?
Would you look just like a male,
If it weren’t for your pigtails?
Are your tits real small?</verse>
		<verse>Are your tits just right?
Are your blouses kind of tight?
If you had a disagreement,
Could you use ‘em in a fight?
Do the boys throw fits,
When you flash ‘em with your tits?
Are your tits just right?</verse>
		<verse>Do your tits go squish,
When you poke them like this?
Do they feel just like,
A slimy jellyfish?
Does your man’s pecker stand,
When he holds them in his hand?
Do your tits go squish?</verse>
		<verse>Are your tits real hard?
Could you use ‘em as a guard?
Do your nipples poke through,
Your pink leotard?
When it’s wet and cold,
Do they stand out proud and bold?
Are your tits real hard?</verse>
		<verse>Do your tits have hair?
Do people stop and stare,
When you wear a french braid,
Down to your underwear?
Do people think your breasts,
Look like your father’s chest?
Do your tits have hair?</verse>
		<verse>Are your tits really real?
Did it take them long to heal?
Are the silicone,
Or saline filled?
Do the boys’ hearts race,
When you shake them in their face?
Are your tits really real?</verse>
		<verse>If your tits are teeny weeny,
Or too big for your bikini,
No matter how they look,
And no matter how they feel,
Be glad that you got ‘em,
‘Cause you know the boys all want ‘em,
– Tits, tits, tits.</verse>

And on Sunday after supper, I rammed the bugger up her,
And now she wants it seven days a week.</verse>

And filled up my brand new sombrero.
Anker because I’m a wanker
Brandy it makes me feel randy
Champagne it makes me cum again
Cider helps me get inside her
Claret it stiffens the carrot
Coke it helps me to poke
Gin it helps me get in
Jack Daniels because “he” fucks spaniels
Ovaltine makes me feel like a fairy queen
Pernod ‘cos it makes my dong grow
Pimms it lubricates quims
Port because “he’s” so short
Rum it helps me to cum
Schnapps it helps me with the chaps (cure the clap)
Seven Up it helps me get my pecker up
Sliwovitz it helps me cum between her tits
Sprite ‘cos I can go all the night
Stout it helps me get out
Tea because “he” gets it for free
Tequila it helps me to feel her
Whisky it makes me feel frisky
Wine it makes me feel fine</verse>
